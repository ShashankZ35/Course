Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Name: Shashank Patil
module name: Divide and conquer
learnings: Each sub-problem is solved independently, and their solutions are combined to solve the original problem. This approach is efficient, especially for recursive algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.
